              "  'description': 'Doing more things with your time. Increasing your productivity. Improving your daily routine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is what you can achieve with TimeTune, your time blocking and schedule planner.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>WHAT IS TIMETUNE?</b>\\r\\n\\r\\nTimeTune is a time blocking and daily planner application. We designed it to help you make better use of your time, increase your productivity and achieve your goals.\\r\\n\\r\\nHave you ever wondered why some people can get plenty of things done in a single day while your time slips through your fingers?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe answer is that they have a very organized distribution of time. They know time is a precious resource and they have strong time management habits. That’s what allows them to focus, seize the day and do everything in their agenda.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith TimeTune you can do the same.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>HOW DOES IT WORK?</b>\\r\\n\\r\\nTimeTune uses time blocks to build your schedule. Just add time blocks to your day or use time blocks to build templates that can be reused at any time, like a morning routine, a full day template or a timetable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe template calendar feature allows you to plan your upcoming schedule, routines, timetables or shift work calendar automatically.\\r\\n\\r\\nTimeTune will show you automatic statistics that will uncover where the time goes and where you can improve.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, you can add custom reminders to your time blocks, so you don’t forget about your agenda: reminders with custom vibrations, reminders with custom sounds, voice reminders, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith TimeTune you can create a time management system as simple or as complex as you need, including statistics. This time blocking and daily schedule planner will allow you to reach your goals and is the perfect complement to your calendar.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>WHY DOES IT WORK?</b>\\r\\n\\r\\nTime blocking is a scheduling method that divides your day into smaller segments of time for specific tasks.
