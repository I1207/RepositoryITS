30,2023,7,First class team,The team at the Armani were amongst the best I’ve ever encountered. Friendly and helpful at every turn. Breakfast was truly amazing with unbelievably fresh fruit and vegetables. The room technology was cumbersome and overdone but the team was always there to help out. Overall we enjoyed our stay though I believe I would choose a bit more of a full service hotel in the future for the price point.
50,2023,7,Modernist Milano,"The Armani is a strikingly modern hotel in the heart of beautiful Milan. While extremely comfortable and well-appointed, it took a bit of work to get used to the iPad managed controls for everything from lights to televisions to doors. It is perfect for those who are very comfortable with technology. You enter on the ground floor and then take an elevator up to 7th floor reception. From there you take another elevator back down or up to your floor to find your room. It would have been helpful for someone to show us how the room worked, and even how to open the door, but that did not happen. We spent way too much time trying to figure out how the room worked. The mini-bar was complementary and we had a voucher for room service which we used. The three-story Armani store is just down the street from the hotel. The included breakfast was nice, but service was slow. The Concierge desk not very helpful either. Overall, an interesting but very non-traditional experience. When in Milan, I would prefer to see the sights not spend time on how to turn off the lights to go to sleep."

50,2023,6,Modern luxurious stay with very friendly staff,"We stayed in this hotel for 5 nights to explore Milan and do some shopping. The room we got was spacious with a large terrace. The staff was extremely friendly and helped us swiftly with all questions and requests we had. The location of the hotel is great, especially since it is right next to a metro stop"
50,2023,5,Better than heaven a true testament of Armani style and detail,No question this is the only place to stay in Milan . The staff is overly qualified. The building is extremely comfortable. The food is five star the location is central and convenient to all things Milan There’s no question of selection this is the only one
50,2023,5,Outstanding time at Armani in Milan,Fantastic experience at the Armani Hotel in Milan. From the moment of arrival until I left the staff at the hotel went out of their way to make my trip completely enjoyable. Virtually all the staff recognized me by my name on each encounter. The Jr Suite was perfect in every respect including the desk area where I needed to work for a couple of hours each day. Restaurant at d bar were excellent as was the fitness level. And the location is spectacular. Will definitely go back ASAP.
40,2023,4,armani hotel milano,"location was great, staff not so great, asked for ashtray when arrived but didn't get it , asked for bathroom cleaning but nobody came to clean, children can't use swimming pool or jacuzzi what should be written on hotel site, we stayed one night less because rain was forecasted and we could not go to spa with our son, be careful when you receive check I got bigger bills twice,"
50,2023,3,"Exceptional service, design and amenities","Exceptional hotel -- the service and amenities leave nothing to be desired. Everywhere you look is beautifully designed. The rooms are modern, high-tech and very comfortable. The hotel is located within the best shopping district, steps to the Duomo and the Galleria. The staff is friendly and helpful. Highly recommend!"
50,2023,3,"Excellet location, service and design","The Armani hotel is beautiful, modern and elegant. The service and amenities are exceptional and it is located within the best shopping district, steps from the Duomo and several good restaurants are nearby. Rooms are beautifully designed and high-tech. Highly recommended."
50,2022,3,Greatest Experience in This Stylish and Well Designed Hotel,"I stayed in Armani Hotel Milano a couple of times. As you probably know, this is one of the best hotels in Milan. Nice style, top quality, great service. If you need to book or order anything concierge would do it for you right away. Make sure to check the Armani restaurant which is on the 7th floor, great steak, pasta, deserts, wines, etc. Grazie Armani. I will be back."
50,2023,8,EB,"Everything is fine, except for the cold feel of the common areas. Maybe a little too futuristic, but there is no warmth. It's not spooky, but close to it. Rooms are comfortable, the bathrooms are great, the staff is accomodating."
30,2023,7,First class team,The team at the Armani were amongst the best I’ve ever encountered. Friendly and helpful at every turn. Breakfast was truly amazing with unbelievably fresh fruit and vegetables. The room technology was cumbersome and overdone but the team was always there to help out. Overall we enjoyed our stay though I believe I would choose a bit more of a full service hotel in the future for the price point.
50,2023,7,Modernist Milano,"The Armani is a strikingly modern hotel in the heart of beautiful Milan. While extremely comfortable and well-appointed, it took a bit of work to get used to the iPad managed controls for everything from lights to televisions to doors. It is perfect for those who are very comfortable with technology. You enter on the ground floor and then take an elevator up to 7th floor reception. From there you take another elevator back down or up to your floor to find your room. It would have been helpful for someone to show us how the room worked, and even how to open the door, but that did not happen. We spent way too much time trying to figure out how the room worked. The mini-bar was complementary and we had a voucher for room service which we used. The three-story Armani store is just down the street from the hotel. The included breakfast was nice, but service was slow. The Concierge desk not very helpful either. Overall, an interesting but very non-traditional experience. When in Milan, I would prefer to see the sights not spend time on how to turn off the lights to go to sleep."
